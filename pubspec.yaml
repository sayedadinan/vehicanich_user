  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/onboarding3.png
    - assets/images/car_workshop_for_splash-removebg-preview 1.png
    - assets/images/img3.png
    - assets/images/user-profile 1.png
    - assets/images/workshop.png
    - assets/images/Animation - 1714891020642.gif
    - .env
    - assets/images/urban-967.png
    - assets/images/add photo.jpg
    - assets/images/ad photo.jpg
    - assets/images/nonetworkImage.png
    - assets/images/successtickimage.png
    - assets/images/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Oswald
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\Oswald-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  #       # - asset: assets/fonts/Oswald-VariableFont_wght.ttf
  # #         style: italic
    - family: FiraSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\FiraSansExtraCondensed-Italic.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
          # weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
